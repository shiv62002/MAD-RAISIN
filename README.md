The goal of this project is to create a simple processor using Unix and Emacs. The processor is generated by developing an assembler to manipulate sample 
instructions created by a pre-existing processor called the MAD Raisin CPU. The MAD Raisin’s 32–bit (4-byte) word length is read in and interpreted to perform 
complex actions using assembly code. More specifically, the word length of the MAD Raisin CPU is composed of opcode (name of the operation for assembly 
instruction), up to two registers used as operands by some instructions, and a memory address for instructions. By reading the appropriate instructions at each 
specific memory location composed within the word length of the processor, bit operators, and arrays are used to handle the appropriate assembler functionalities. 

This project highlights my proficiency in utilizing UNIX commands to write complex C code. Additionally, the project highlights my familiarity with using EMACs 
to perform complex bitwise operations within any operating system. The code also showcases my ability to interpret assembly instructions, scan values through a 
reader, manipulate arrays, and create a processor in C.
